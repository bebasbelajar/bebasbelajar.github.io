Nura arrives in a big city to help her parents settle their debts. She moves into Juna’s house as a hired servant. In the house, Juna is a rich and proud
young man who inherits his father’s business. He is lazy and goes to campus just to meet friends and chase pretty girls who love his wealth.
In his chaotic life, Juna is betrayed by his own cousin and uncle leading to his downfall. Juna’s life is in a real mess. However, Nura helps him gain his confidence and reorganize his life. Nura begins to teach the rich spoiled brat some manners through her down to earth scolding and no-nonsense attitude. The girl helps him pick up the pieces in his life, from defeat to success. Finally, after a long struggle and hard work, he can regain his life. He is now in the position of the director of the company that he inherits from his father.</a>

                                            The railroad was not the first institution to impose regularity on society, or to draw attention to the importance of precise timekeeping. For as long as merchants have set out their wares at daybreak and communal festivities have been celebrated, people have been in rough agreement with their neighbors as to the time of day. The value of this tradition is today more apparent than ever. Were it not for public acceptance of a single yardstick of time, social life would be unbearably chaotic: the massive daily transfers of goods, services, and information would proceed in fits and starts; the very fabric of modern society would begin to unravel. 3.

The abbreviation of Supersemar is a play on the name of Semar, the mystic and powerful figure who commonly appears in Javanese mythology including wayang puppet shows.

The value of this tradition is today more apparent than ever. Were it not for public acceptance of a single yardstick of time, social life would be unbearably chaotic: the massive daily transfers of goods, services, and information would proceed in fits and starts; the very fabric of modern society would begin to unravel.

                                            Chaotic Situation in the MarketLast week, I went to a traditional market to buy some daily needs. As usual, I went there alone and brought a shopping list.After arriving at the market, I started searching the things I needed one by one. While I was bargaining the price of some fruits, I saw a crowded situation. I was so curious. I came closer to see what has happened. There was a thief beaten by a lot of people. It was so terrible. The man was bleeding and injured on whole his body. I didn’t want the condition getting worse, so I called the police. A few minutes later, police came and calmed down the situation. The police brought the man to the police office.Asking the fruit seller, I knew that the thief tried to steal someone’s wallet but the other saw him and shouted loudly. After that many people caught and beat him hardly. It was a scary moment I experienced last week and I hoped that it will never happen again.

                            9. The railroad was not the first institution to impose regularity on society, or to draw attention to the importance of precise timekeeping. For as long as merchants have set out their wares at daybreak and communal festivities have been celebrated, people have been in rough agreement with their neighbors as to the time of day. The value of this tradition is today more apparent than ever. Were it not for public acceptance of a single yardstick of time, social life would be unbearably chaotic: the massive daily transfers of goods, services, and information would proceed in fits and starts; the very fabric of modern society would begin to unravel. 3.

                            25. Chaotic Situation in the MarketLast week, I went to a traditional market to buy some daily needs. As usual, I went there alone and brought a shopping list.After arriving at the market, I started searching the things I needed one by one. While I was bargaining the price of some fruits, I saw a crowded situation. I was so curious. I came closer to see what has happened. There was a thief beaten by a lot of people. It was so terrible. The man was bleeding and injured on whole his body. I didn’t want the condition getting worse, so I called the police. A few minutes later, police came and calmed down the situation. The police brought the man to the police office.Asking the fruit seller, I knew that the thief tried to steal someone’s wallet but the other saw him and shouted loudly. After that many people caught and beat him hardly. It was a scary moment I experienced last week and I hoped that it will never happen again.
