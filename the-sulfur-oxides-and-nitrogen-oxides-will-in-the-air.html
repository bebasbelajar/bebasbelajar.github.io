The public is unaware of the danger. But experts have learned that 92 percent of cigarette smoke is composed largely of deadly dozen gases. Among them are three targeted as most poisonous: carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and nitrogen oxides. This toxic trio, together with nicotine, is held responsible for many of the 200,000 cigarette-related premature deaths each year in the united states from heart and circulatory diseases, emphysema and chronic bronchitis about three time as many as from lung cancer by tar. Toxicologist Gio Gori, head of the National Cancer Institute’s Tobacco Working Group, warns: “A cigarette may be low in tar and nicotine, and still be highly dangerous because of the gas it produces.”</a>

                                            Air Pollution is addition of harmful substances to the atmosphere resulting in damage to the environment, human health, and quality of life. One of many forms of pollution, air pollution occurs inside homes, schools, and offices; in cities; across continents; and even globally. Air pollution makes people sick, it causes breathing problems and promotes cancer, and it harms plants, animals, and the ecosystems in which they live. Some air pollutants return to earth in the form of acid rain and snow, which corrode statues and buildings, damage crops and forests, and make lakes and streams unsuitable for fish and other plant and animal life.Pollution is changing the earth's atmosphere so that it lets in more harmful radiation from the sun. At the same time, our polluted atmosphere is becoming a better insulator, preventing heat from escaping back into space and leading to a rise in global average temperatures. Scientists predict that the temperature increase, referred to as global warming, will affect world food supply, alter sea level, make weather more extreme, and increase the spread of tropical disease.Most air pollution comes from one human activity: burning fossil fuels, natural gas, coal, and oil to power industrial processes and motor vehicles. Among the harmful chemical compounds this burning puts into the atmosphere are carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and tiny solid particles including lead from gasoline additives called particulates. Between 1900 and 1970, motor vehicle use rapidly expanded, and emissions of nitrogen oxides, some of the most damaging pollutants invehicle exhaust, increased 690 percent. When fuels are incompletely burned, various chemicals called volatile organic chemicals also enter the air. Pollutants also come from other sources. For instance, decomposing garbage in landfills and solid waste disposal sites emits methane gas, and many household products give off Volatile organic chemicals.Some of these pollutants also come from natural sources. For example, forest fires emit particulates and Volatile organic chemicals into the atmosphere. Ultrafine dust particles, dislodged by soil erosion when water and weather loosen layers of soil, increase airborne particulate levels. Volcanoesspew out sulfur dioxide and large amounts of pulverized lava rock known as volcanic ash. A big volcanic eruption can darken the sky over a wide region and affect the earth's entire atmosphere. The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatoubo in the Philippines, for example, dumped enough volcanic ash into the upper atmosphere to lower global temperatures for the next two years. Unlike pollutants from human activity, however, naturally occurring pollutants tend to remain in the atmosphere for a short time and do not lead to permanent atmospheric change Once in the atmosphere, pollutants often undergo chemical reactions that produce additional harmful compounds. Air pollutants is subject to weather patterns that can trap it in valleys or blow it across the globe to damage pristine environments far from the original sources

                                            Read the following Explanation, then answer the question!\n
Acid rain is rain that is highly acidic because of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and other air pollutants dissolved in it. Normal rain is slightly acidic, with a pH of 6. Acid rain may have a pH value as low as 2.8.
Acid rain can severely damage both plant and animal life. Certain lakes, for example, have lost all fish and plant life because of acid rain.
Acid rain comes from sulfur in coal and oil. When they burn, they make sulfur dioxide (SO2). Most sulfur leaves factory chimneys as the gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO2) and most nitrogen are also emitted as one of the nitrogen oxides (NO or NO2), both of which are gasses. The gasses may be dry deposited–absorbed directly by the land, by lakes or by the surface vegetation. If they are in the atmosphere for anytime, the gasses will oxidize (gain an oxygen atom) and go into solution as acids. Sulphuric acid (H2 SO4) and the nitrogen oxides will become nitric acid (HNO3). The acids usually dissolve in cloud droplets and may travel great distances before being precipitated as acid rain.
Catalysts such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and ammonium help promote the formation of acids in clouds. More ammonium (NH4) can be formed when some of the acids are partially neutralized by airborne ammonia (NH3). Acidification increases with the number of active hydrogen (H+) ions dissolved in acid. Hydrocarbons emitted by, for example, car exhausts will react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone. Although it is invaluable in the atmosphere, low-level ozone causes respiratory problems and also hastens the formation of acid rain. When acid rain falls on the ground it dissolves and liberates heavy metals and aluminum (Al). When it is washed into lakes, aluminum irritates the outer surfaces of many fish. As acid rain falls or drains into the lake the pH of the lake falls. Forests suffer the effect of acid rain through damage to leaves, through the loss of vital nutrients, and through the increased amounts of toxic metals liberated by acid, which damage roots and soil microorganisms.

                                            Air Pollution is addition of harmful substances to the atmosphere resulting in damage to the environment, human health, and quality of life. One of many forms of pollution, air pollution occurs inside homes, schools, and offices; in cities; across continents; and even globally. Air pollution makes people sick, it causes breathing problems and promotes cancer, and it harms plants, animals, and the ecosystems in which they live. Some air pollutants return to earth in the form of acid rain and snow, which corrode statues and buildings, damage crops and forests, and make lakes and streams unsuitable for fish and other plant and animal life.Pollution is changing the earth's atmosphere so that it lets in more harmful radiation from the sun. At the same time, our polluted atmosphere is becoming a better insulator, preventing heat from escaping back into space and leading to a rise in global average temperatures. Scientists predict that the temperature increase, referred to as global warming, will affect world food supply, alter sea level, make weather more extreme, and increase the spread of tropical disease.Most air pollution comes from one human activity: burning fossil fuels, natural gas, coal, and oil to power industrial processes and motor vehicles. Among the harmful chemical compounds this burning puts into the atmosphere are carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and tiny solid particles including lead from gasoline additives called particulates. Between 1900 and 1970, motor vehicle use rapidly expanded, and emissions of nitrogen oxides, some of the most damaging pollutants invehicle exhaust, increased 690 percent. When fuels are incompletely burned, various chemicals called volatile organic chemicals also enter the air. Pollutants also come from other sources. For instance, decomposing garbage in landfills and solid waste disposal sites emits methane gas, and many household products give off Volatile organic chemicals.Some of these pollutants also come from natural sources. For example, forest fires emit particulates and Volatile organic chemicals into the atmosphere. Ultrafine dust particles, dislodged by soil erosion when water and weather loosen layers of soil, increase airborne particulate levels. Volcanoesspew out sulfur dioxide and large amounts of pulverized lava rock known as volcanic ash. A big volcanic eruption can darken the sky over a wide region and affect the earth's entire atmosphere. The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatoubo in the Philippines, for example, dumped enough volcanic ash into the upper atmosphere to lower global temperatures for the next two years. Unlike pollutants from human activity, however, naturally occurring pollutants tend to remain in the atmosphere for a short time and do not lead to permanent atmospheric change.Once in tho atmosphere, pollutants often undergo chemical reactions thai produce addltional harmful compounds. Air pollution is subject to weather patterre that can trap it in velleys or blow it across the gioba to damage pristine environments far trom the original sourcesFind the sentences showing cause and effect from the text aboveTemukan kalimat cause dan effect dalam teks diatas</a>

                                            Acid Rain
Acid rain is rain that is highly acidic because of sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and other air pollutants dissolve in it. Normal rain is slightly acidic, with a pH od 6. Acid rain may have a pH value as low as 2.8.
Acid rain can severely damage both plant and animal life. Certain lakes for example, have lost all fish and plant life because of acid rain.
Acid rain comes from sulphur in coal and oil. When they burn, they make sulphur dioxide (SO2). Most sulphur leave factory chimney as the gaseous sulphur dioxide (SO2) and most nitrogen is also emitted as one of the nitrogen oxides (NO or NO2), both of which are gases. The gases may be dry deposited-absorbed directly by the land, by lakes, or by the surface vegetation. If they are in the atmosphere for any time, the gas will oxidise (gain an oxygen atom) an go into solution as acids.
Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and the nitrogen oxides will become nitric acid (HNO3). The acids usually dissolve in cloud droplets and may travel great distance before being precipitated as acid rain. Catalysts such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone and ammonium help promote the formation of acids in clouds. More ammonium (NH4) can be formed when some of the acids are partially neutralized airborne ammonia (NH3). Acidification increases with the number of active hydrogen (H+) ions dissolve in acid. Hydrocarbons emitted by for example car exhaust will react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone. Although it is invaluable in the atmosphere, low level ozone causes respiratory problems and hastens the formation of acid rain. When acids rain falls on the ground it dissolved and liberates heavy metals and aluminium (Al). when it is washed into lakes, aluminium irritates the outer surface of many fish. As acid rain falls or drains into the lake the pH of the lakes falls. Forest suffer the effect of acid rain through damage to leaves, through the lost of vital nutrients and through the increased amount of toxic metals liberated by acid, which damage roots and soil microorganism.

                                            II. Read the text and answer the questions!Air PollutionAir pollution is addition of harmful substances to the atmosphere resulting in damage to theenvironment, human health, and quality of life. One of many forms of pollution, air pollutionoccurs inside homes, schools, and offices: in cities; across continents; and even globally. Air pollutionmakes people sick-it causes breathing problems and promotes cancer-and it harms plants, animals,and the ecosystems in which they live. Some air pollutants return to Earth in the form of acid rainand snow, which corrode statues and buildings, damage crops and forests, and make lakes andstreams unsuitable for fish and other plant and animal life.Pollution is changing Earth's atmosphere so that it lets in mare harmful radiation from the Sun.At the same time, our polluted atmosphere is becoming a better insulator, preventing heat fromescaping back into space and leading to a rise in global average temperatures. Scientists predictthat the temperature increase, referred to as global warming, will affect world food supply, altersea level, make weather more extreme, and increase the spread of tropical diseases.Most air pollution comes from one human activity: burning fossil fuels-natural gas, coal, andoil-to power industrial processes and motor vehicles. Among the harmful chemical compoundsthis burning puts into the atmosphere are carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides,sulfur dioxide, and tiny solid particles-including lead from gasoline additives-called particulates.Between 1900 and 1970, motor vehicle use rapidly expanded, and emissions of nitrogen oxides,some of the most damaging pollutants in vehicle exhaust, increased 690 percent. When fuels areincompletely burned, various chemicals called volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) also enter theair. Pollutants also come from other sources. For instance, decomposing garbage in landfills andsolid waste disposal sites emits methane gas, and many household products give off VOCs.Some of these pollutants also come from natural sources. For example, forest fires emitparticulates and VOCs into the atmosphere. Ultrafine dust particles, dislodged by soil erosion whenwater and weather loosen layers of soil, increase airborne particulate levels. Volcanoes spew outsulfur dioxide and large amounts of pulverized lava rock known as volcanic ash. A big volcaniceruption can darken the sky over a wide region and affect the Earth's entire atmosphere. The1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, for example, dumped enough volcanic ashinto the upper atmosphere to lower global temperatures for the next two years. Unlike pollutantsfrom human activity, however, naturally occurring pollutants tend to remain in the atmospherefor a short time and do not lead to permanent atmospheric change.Once in the atmosphere, pollutants often undergo chemical reactions that produce additionalharmful compounds. Air pollution is subject to weather patterns that can trap it in valleys or blowit across the globe to damage pristine environments far from the original sources.(Taken from: Hart, John.

The public is unaware of the danger. But experts have learned that 92 percent of cigarette smoke is composed largely of deadly dozen gases. Among them are three targeted as most poisonous: carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and nitrogen oxides. This toxic trio, together with nicotine, is held responsible for many of the 200,000 cigarette-related premature deaths each year in the united states from heart and circulatory diseases, emphysema and chronic bronchitis about three time as many as from lung cancer by tar. Toxicologist Gio Gori, head of the National Cancer Institute’s Tobacco Working Group, warns: “A cigarette may be low in tar and nicotine, and still be highly dangerous because of the gas it produces.”</h2><br />

                            6. Air Pollution is addition of harmful substances to the atmosphere resulting in damage to the environment, human health, and quality of life. One of many forms of pollution, air pollution occurs inside homes, schools, and offices; in cities; across continents; and even globally. Air pollution makes people sick, it causes breathing problems and promotes cancer, and it harms plants, animals, and the ecosystems in which they live. Some air pollutants return to earth in the form of acid rain and snow, which corrode statues and buildings, damage crops and forests, and make lakes and streams unsuitable for fish and other plant and animal life.Pollution is changing the earth's atmosphere so that it lets in more harmful radiation from the sun. At the same time, our polluted atmosphere is becoming a better insulator, preventing heat from escaping back into space and leading to a rise in global average temperatures. Scientists predict that the temperature increase, referred to as global warming, will affect world food supply, alter sea level, make weather more extreme, and increase the spread of tropical disease.Most air pollution comes from one human activity: burning fossil fuels, natural gas, coal, and oil to power industrial processes and motor vehicles. Among the harmful chemical compounds this burning puts into the atmosphere are carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and tiny solid particles including lead from gasoline additives called particulates. Between 1900 and 1970, motor vehicle use rapidly expanded, and emissions of nitrogen oxides, some of the most damaging pollutants invehicle exhaust, increased 690 percent. When fuels are incompletely burned, various chemicals called volatile organic chemicals also enter the air. Pollutants also come from other sources. For instance, decomposing garbage in landfills and solid waste disposal sites emits methane gas, and many household products give off Volatile organic chemicals.Some of these pollutants also come from natural sources. For example, forest fires emit particulates and Volatile organic chemicals into the atmosphere. Ultrafine dust particles, dislodged by soil erosion when water and weather loosen layers of soil, increase airborne particulate levels. Volcanoesspew out sulfur dioxide and large amounts of pulverized lava rock known as volcanic ash. A big volcanic eruption can darken the sky over a wide region and affect the earth's entire atmosphere. The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatoubo in the Philippines, for example, dumped enough volcanic ash into the upper atmosphere to lower global temperatures for the next two years. Unlike pollutants from human activity, however, naturally occurring pollutants tend to remain in the atmosphere for a short time and do not lead to permanent atmospheric change Once in the atmosphere, pollutants often undergo chemical reactions that produce additional harmful compounds. Air pollutants is subject to weather patterns that can trap it in valleys or blow it across the globe to damage pristine environments far from the original sources

                            7. Read the following Explanation, then answer the question!\n
Acid rain is rain that is highly acidic because of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and other air pollutants dissolved in it. Normal rain is slightly acidic, with a pH of 6. Acid rain may have a pH value as low as 2.8.
Acid rain can severely damage both plant and animal life. Certain lakes, for example, have lost all fish and plant life because of acid rain.
Acid rain comes from sulfur in coal and oil. When they burn, they make sulfur dioxide (SO2). Most sulfur leaves factory chimneys as the gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO2) and most nitrogen are also emitted as one of the nitrogen oxides (NO or NO2), both of which are gasses. The gasses may be dry deposited–absorbed directly by the land, by lakes or by the surface vegetation. If they are in the atmosphere for anytime, the gasses will oxidize (gain an oxygen atom) and go into solution as acids. Sulphuric acid (H2 SO4) and the nitrogen oxides will become nitric acid (HNO3). The acids usually dissolve in cloud droplets and may travel great distances before being precipitated as acid rain.
Catalysts such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and ammonium help promote the formation of acids in clouds. More ammonium (NH4) can be formed when some of the acids are partially neutralized by airborne ammonia (NH3). Acidification increases with the number of active hydrogen (H+) ions dissolved in acid. Hydrocarbons emitted by, for example, car exhausts will react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone. Although it is invaluable in the atmosphere, low-level ozone causes respiratory problems and also hastens the formation of acid rain. When acid rain falls on the ground it dissolves and liberates heavy metals and aluminum (Al). When it is washed into lakes, aluminum irritates the outer surfaces of many fish. As acid rain falls or drains into the lake the pH of the lake falls. Forests suffer the effect of acid rain through damage to leaves, through the loss of vital nutrients, and through the increased amounts of toxic metals liberated by acid, which damage roots and soil microorganisms.

Acid rain is rain that is highly acidic because of sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and other air pollutants dissolve in it. Normal rain is slightly acidic, with a pH od 6. Acid rain may have a pH value as low as 2.8.
Acid rain can severely damage both plant and animal life. Certain lakes for example, have lost all fish and plant life because of acid rain.
Acid rain comes from sulphur in coal and oil. When they burn, they make sulphur dioxide (SO2). Most sulphur leave factory chimney as the gaseous sulphur dioxide (SO2) and most nitrogen is also emitted as one of the nitrogen oxides (NO or NO2), both of which are gases. The gases may be dry deposited-absorbed directly by the land, by lakes, or by the surface vegetation. If they are in the atmosphere for any time, the gas will oxidise (gain an oxygen atom) an go into solution as acids.
Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and the nitrogen oxides will become nitric acid (HNO3). The acids usually dissolve in cloud droplets and may travel great distance before being precipitated as acid rain. Catalysts such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone and ammonium help promote the formation of acids in clouds. More ammonium (NH4) can be formed when some of the acids are partially neutralized airborne ammonia (NH3). Acidification increases with the number of active hydrogen (H+) ions dissolve in acid. Hydrocarbons emitted by for example car exhaust will react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone. Although it is invaluable in the atmosphere, low level ozone causes respiratory problems and hastens the formation of acid rain. When acids rain falls on the ground it dissolved and liberates heavy metals and aluminium (Al). when it is washed into lakes, aluminium irritates the outer surface of many fish. As acid rain falls or drains into the lake the pH of the lakes falls. Forest suffer the effect of acid rain through damage to leaves, through the lost of vital nutrients and through the increased amount of toxic metals liberated by acid, which damage roots and soil microorganism.
the gases may be drying deposited absorbed directly by the land,by lakes or by the surface "vegetation"

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Sulfur dan Nitrogen berlebih pada air dapat menyebabkan tumbuhan seperti eceng gondok tumbuh tak terkendali, sehingga O2 di dalam air semakin berkurang karena dipakai oleh eceng gondok. Selain itu, pertumbuhannya yang tidak terkendali akan menyebabkan terhalangnya sinar matahari, sehingga plankton atau tumbuhan air lainnya tidak bisa melakukan fotosintesis. Akibatnya adalah terjadinya kekurangan O2 sehingga terjadi kematian biota perairan</p><br />

                            29. The following text is for number 6-10 Acid rain is rain that is highly acidic because of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and other air pollutants dissolved in it. Normal rain is slightly acidic, with a pH of 6. Acid rain may have a pH value as low as 2.8.Acid rain can severely damage both plant and animal life. Certain lakes, for example, have lost all fish and plant life because of acid rain.Acid rain comes from sulfur in coal and oil. When they burn, they make sulfur dioxide (SO₂). Most sulfur leaves factory chimneys as the gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and most nitrogen oxides (NO ᴏr NO₂), both of which are gasses. The gasses may be dry deposited-absorbed directly by the land, by lakes or by the surface vegetation. If they are in the atmosphere for anytime, the glasses will oxidize (gain an oxygen atom) and go into solution as acids. Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and the nitrogen oxides will become nitric acid (HNO₃). The acids usually dissolve in cloud droplets and may travel great distances before being precipitated as acid rain. Catalysts such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and ammonium help promote the formation of acid in clouds. More ammonium (NH₄) can be formed when some of the acids are partially neutralized by airborne ammonia (NH₃). Acidification increases with the number of active hydrogen (H⁺) ions dissolved in acid. Hydrocarbons emitted by, for example, car exhaust will react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone. Although it is invaluable in the atmosphere, low-level ozone causes respiratory problems and also hastens the formation of acid rain. When acid rain falls on the ground it dissolves and liberates heavy metals and aluminum (Al). When it is washes into lakes, aluminum irritates the outer surfaces of many fish. As acid rain falls or drains into the lake the pH of the lake falls. Forests suffer the effect of acid rain through damage to leaves, through the loss of vital nutrients, and through the increased amounts of toxic metals liberated by acid, which damage roots and soil microorganisms. *What is the text mainly about? *​</h2><br />

                            30. II. Read the text and answer the questions!Air PollutionAir pollution is addition of harmful substances to the atmosphere resulting in damage to theenvironment, human health, and quality of life. One of many forms of pollution, air pollutionoccurs inside homes, schools, and offices: in cities; across continents; and even globally. Air pollutionmakes people sick-it causes breathing problems and promotes cancer-and it harms plants, animals,and the ecosystems in which they live. Some air pollutants return to Earth in the form of acid rainand snow, which corrode statues and buildings, damage crops and forests, and make lakes andstreams unsuitable for fish and other plant and animal life.Pollution is changing Earth's atmosphere so that it lets in mare harmful radiation from the Sun.At the same time, our polluted atmosphere is becoming a better insulator, preventing heat fromescaping back into space and leading to a rise in global average temperatures. Scientists predictthat the temperature increase, referred to as global warming, will affect world food supply, altersea level, make weather more extreme, and increase the spread of tropical diseases.Most air pollution comes from one human activity: burning fossil fuels-natural gas, coal, andoil-to power industrial processes and motor vehicles. Among the harmful chemical compoundsthis burning puts into the atmosphere are carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides,sulfur dioxide, and tiny solid particles-including lead from gasoline additives-called particulates.Between 1900 and 1970, motor vehicle use rapidly expanded, and emissions of nitrogen oxides,some of the most damaging pollutants in vehicle exhaust, increased 690 percent. When fuels areincompletely burned, various chemicals called volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) also enter theair. Pollutants also come from other sources. For instance, decomposing garbage in landfills andsolid waste disposal sites emits methane gas, and many household products give off VOCs.Some of these pollutants also come from natural sources. For example, forest fires emitparticulates and VOCs into the atmosphere. Ultrafine dust particles, dislodged by soil erosion whenwater and weather loosen layers of soil, increase airborne particulate levels. Volcanoes spew outsulfur dioxide and large amounts of pulverized lava rock known as volcanic ash. A big volcaniceruption can darken the sky over a wide region and affect the Earth's entire atmosphere. The1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, for example, dumped enough volcanic ashinto the upper atmosphere to lower global temperatures for the next two years. Unlike pollutantsfrom human activity, however, naturally occurring pollutants tend to remain in the atmospherefor a short time and do not lead to permanent atmospheric change.Once in the atmosphere, pollutants often undergo chemical reactions that produce additionalharmful compounds. Air pollution is subject to weather patterns that can trap it in valleys or blowit across the globe to damage pristine environments far from the original sources.(Taken from: Hart, John.
